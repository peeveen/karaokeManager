* Maintains a list of singers and their selected songs, key changes, etc.
* Easily add/delete/move singers and songs with short, simple commands.
* Drives Winamp as the MP3/CDG player.
* Cue up music tracks inbetween singers.
* Automatically sets and resets Pacemaker pitch changes via pre-configured hotkeys.
* Fast undo & redo functionality for fat finger syndrome.
* Singers maintain their position in the queue, even if they have no songs cued up.
* Works with my SingerQueue and AutoDJ Winamp plugins.

### TODO
* Improve customization (currently requires specifically formatted filenames, extensions, hotkeys, etc)
